# What Is GroupNews?

GroupNews is a centralized news source for your group or organization. It empowers people across your group to know what's going on.

## Working in GroupNews

Your GroupNews is made of one or more [newsletters](/using-groupnews/newsletters) that are combined together into a news hub for your group or organization. Each newsletter can have its own [authors](/using-groupnews/authors), its own [publishing schedule](/using-groupnews/newsletters/publishing-schedule/), and even its own [audience](/using-groupnews/newsletters/subscribers/).
