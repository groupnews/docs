# Getting Started for Group Creators

A GroupNews Group is a single place for your group and its news. Looking for more information about creating or managing your new GroupNews Group? This guide is for you, and we’re glad you’re here!

## 1. Create A Group

## 2. Invite People To Your Group

## 3. Create a Newsletter

Next, you’ll need to set up a newsletter for your group in order for people to have some news to read. You can set up just one newsletter, or you can set up as many as you’d like.

## 4. Get Your Group Members Up To Speed

Once your group is set up, you can share the following resources to help everyone get familiar with GroupNews:
