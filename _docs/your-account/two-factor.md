# Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor Authentication is an extra layer of security which ensures that only you can access your GroupNews account, even if somebody else knows your password.

When you sign into GroupNews with Two-factor Authentication (2FA) enabled, in addition to your password, you'll also be required to enter a one-time use code generated on a device you own. Most commonly, you would use an authenticator app on your phone to generate 2FA codes.

## How 2FA works:

* **You’ll need access to your mobile phone when you sign in to GroupNews.**
* You'll enter a verification code and your password each time you sign in.
* You can choose to send your verification code by text message or from an authentication app.

## Step 1: Download and install an authentication app

Before you can set up 2FA on your account, you’ll need to download and install an authentication app on your device. GroupNews 2FA can be used with most Time-Based, One-Time Password (TOTP) applications. Here are a few options to get you started:

* If you don't have an authentication app, we recommend one of the following:
  * **Microsoft Authenticator** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id983156458), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator))
  * **Authy** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy))
