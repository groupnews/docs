## Visibility

A newsletter's visibility determines who can read the newsletter. Newsletters can have one of three visibility settings:

- **Group**  
  Visible to everyone in your group.
- **Private**  
  Only visible to people in your group who are added as subscribers to that newsletter.
- **World**  
  The newsletter will be publicly available to read anywhere in the world.

### Setting A Newsletter's Visibility

When you create a new newsletter, it will be visible to everyone in your group by default.
