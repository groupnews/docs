Newsletters are centralized sources of shared information within [Groups](https://docs.groupnews.com/using-groupnews/groups/what-is-a-group/ "Groups"). Groups can set up as many newsletters as they need. Newsletters are given a name and description and can be given different [Visibility Settings](https://docs.groupnews.com/using-groupnews/newsletters/settings/ "Settings"). All newsletters need [Authors](https://docs.groupnews.com/using-groupnews/authors/what-is-an-author/ "Authors") or members who will contribute content, and some newsletters will have [Subscribers](https://docs.groupnews.com/using-groupnews/newsletters/subscribers/ "Subscribers"), members who will have access to the newsletter.
