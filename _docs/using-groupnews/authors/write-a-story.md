# Write A Story

## Selecting a Newsletter

If you're an author for only one newsletter in your Group, your story will be published in that newsletter. In some cases, though, you may have to select which newsletter your story will get published in. You will see a newsletter selector on your story edit toolbar if:

- You are an author for more than one your Group's newsletters
- More than one those newsletters has upcoming editions that will be published.
