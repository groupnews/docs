# Story Submissions

When you've finished working on the draft of a story, and you are ready for your Group to read it, you must submit it for publication. Once you submit a story, it will be published in the next edition of the Newsletter [you've assigned it to](/using-groupnews/authors/write-a-story#selecting-a-newsletter).
